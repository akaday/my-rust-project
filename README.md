## Features

- **Core Job Search Logic**: Implemented in Rust with functions for keyword search, location filtering, and company filtering.
- **Integration**: Easy integration with other languages like Python or JavaScript through FFI or WebAssembly.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rust and Cargo**: Ensure that Rust and Cargo are installed.
  ```bash
  rustc --version
  cargo --version
Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/akaday/my-rust-project.git
cd my-rust-project
Build the Project:

bash
cargo build
Run the Project:

bash
cargo run
Usage
Running the Example
The main Rust project demonstrates job search functionalities:

rust
extern crate job_search;

fn main() {
    let jobs = vec![
        "Software Engineer at Google",
        "Data Scientist at Facebook",
        "Backend Developer at Amazon",
    ];

    let keyword = "Engineer";
    let filtered_jobs = job_search::search_jobs(keyword, jobs.iter().map(AsRef::as_ref).collect());

    println!("Filtered Jobs for '{}': {:?}", keyword, filtered_jobs);
}
Using the Library
You can use the job_search library in other projects by adding it to your Cargo.toml:

toml
[dependencies]
job_search = { path = "path/to/job_search" }

### Examples of Using New Functions

#### Filtering Jobs by Salary Range

```rust
extern crate job_search;

fn main() {
    let jobs = vec![
        ("Software Engineer at Google", 120000, "Full-time", "Mid-level"),
        ("Data Scientist at Facebook", 130000, "Full-time", "Senior"),
        ("Backend Developer at Amazon", 110000, "Part-time", "Junior"),
    ];

    let min_salary = 115000;
    let max_salary = 125000;
    let filtered_by_salary = job_search::filter_jobs_by_salary_range(min_salary, max_salary, jobs.iter().map(|(title, salary, _, _)| (*title, *salary)).collect());

    println!("Filtered Jobs by Salary Range ({} - {}): {:?}", min_salary, max_salary, filtered_by_salary);
}
```

#### Filtering Jobs by Job Type

```rust
extern crate job_search;

fn main() {
    let jobs = vec![
        ("Software Engineer at Google", 120000, "Full-time", "Mid-level"),
        ("Data Scientist at Facebook", 130000, "Full-time", "Senior"),
        ("Backend Developer at Amazon", 110000, "Part-time", "Junior"),
    ];

    let job_type = "Full-time";
    let filtered_by_job_type = job_search::filter_jobs_by_job_type(job_type, jobs.iter().map(|(title, _, jt, _)| (*title, *jt)).collect());

    println!("Filtered Jobs by Job Type ({}): {:?}", job_type, filtered_by_job_type);
}
```

#### Filtering Jobs by Experience Level

```rust
extern crate job_search;

fn main() {
    let jobs = vec![
        ("Software Engineer at Google", 120000, "Full-time", "Mid-level"),
        ("Data Scientist at Facebook", 130000, "Full-time", "Senior"),
        ("Backend Developer at Amazon", 110000, "Part-time", "Junior"),
    ];

    let experience_level = "Senior";
    let filtered_by_experience = job_search::filter_jobs_by_experience_level(experience_level, jobs.iter().map(|(title, _, _, exp)| (*title, *exp)).collect());

    println!("Filtered Jobs by Experience Level ({}): {:?}", experience_level, filtered_by_experience);
}
```
